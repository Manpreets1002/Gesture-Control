# 🖐️ Gesture-Control
Gesture-Control is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that enables users to perform desktop tasks like mouse movement, single/double clicks, minimizing and closing windows, and task switching — all using just hand gestures captured via the device’s integrated camera.

Built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, the system applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to recognize and map hand gestures to system-level actions. It offers a touchless, intuitive, and accessible way to interact with your computer without the need for external hardware or traditional input devices.
